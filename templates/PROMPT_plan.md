0a. Study `specs/*` to learn the application specifications.
0b. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present) to understand the plan so far.
0c. Study `src/lib/*` to understand shared utilities and components.
0d. For reference, the application source code is in `src/*`.

1. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present; it may be incorrect) and compare source code against `specs/*`. Identify missing pieces and create/update @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md as a bullet list sorted by priority. Plan only. Do NOT implement anything. Do NOT assume functionality is missing; confirm with code search first.

ULTIMATE GOAL: Achieve the project-specific goal. If an element is missing, search first to confirm it doesn't exist, then if needed author the specification at specs/FILENAME.md. If you create a new element then document the plan to implement it in @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md.
